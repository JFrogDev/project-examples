# gradle-multimodule-library-example
This multi-module example is in support of the __all-in-one open-source project library__ use-case:
  
  * one or more core libraries (my-jwt)
  * one or more framework adaptions of core libraries
  * examples 
    * part of the multi-module build, but still
    * standalone, and easily copied as-is

The examples are configured differently because they are standalone applications (not libraries) and should not be published.
